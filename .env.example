# Environment Variables for easyBacklog
# ==============================================================================
# This file configures external services and application behavior.
# Copy this file to .env and customize as needed:
#
#   cp .env.example .env
#
# For local development, you can leave most values as-is. The application
# will work without external services configured.
# ==============================================================================

# Foreman Configuration
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FOREMAN enables Foreman-style process management (used in production)
# For Docker development, this is typically not needed.
FOREMAN=true

# Email Service (SendGrid)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SendGrid is used to send transactional emails (signup confirmations,
# password resets, notifications).
#
# For local development: Leave blank to disable email sending (emails will
# be logged to console instead).
#
# To enable SendGrid:
# 1. Sign up at https://sendgrid.com (free tier available)
# 2. Generate an API key in your SendGrid dashboard
# 3. Set your credentials below
SENDGRID_USERNAME=[username]
SENDGRID_PASSWORD=[password]

# Real-time Collaboration (Ably)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ably provides WebSocket connectivity for real-time features like:
# - Live updates when team members edit backlogs
# - Instant notifications
# - Real-time synchronization
#
# For local development: Leave blank to disable real-time features.
# The application will work in "single-user mode" without collaboration.
#
# To enable Ably:
# 1. Sign up at https://ably.com (free tier available)
# 2. Create an app in the Ably dashboard
# 3. Copy your API key here
ABLY_API_KEY=[API key from ably.io dashboard]

# ==============================================================================
# Additional Notes for Students:
#
# - Environment variables are a best practice for separating configuration
#   from code. This makes it easy to use different settings in development,
#   staging, and production.
#
# - Never commit actual credentials to version control! The .gitignore file
#   excludes .env to prevent accidental commits.
#
# - For production deployments, use your hosting provider's secrets management
#   instead of a .env file (e.g., Heroku Config Vars, AWS Secrets Manager).
